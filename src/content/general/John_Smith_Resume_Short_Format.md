**PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY**

Technical leader with 25+ years of experience transforming delivery organizations and executing complex cloud modernization through cross-functional collaboration. Refined core engineering disciplines (TDD, Continuous Delivery, Refactoring) during the formative XP era at Meridian Consulting (2001–2005). Leveraged these approaches with technical and business stakeholders to execute large-scale solutions, including a $65M pipeline integrity program. Transformed delivery with fellow Meridian alumni at Maya from being perpetually stuck on release candidates (9+ months overdue) to on-time quarterly releases via multidisciplinary teams, engineering practices, and cultural change.

**Core Philosophy**: Automation increases quality via consistency. Quality increases agility. Every line of code enhances or degrades the architectural design.

**SKILLS**

**Architecture & Strategy:** Microservices | Distributed Systems | Event-Driven Architecture (Kafka) | API Design (GraphQL, REST) | Cloud Architecture | Design Patterns | Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

**Practices & Delivery:** DevOps (CI/CD) | Iterative Delivery / Continuous Improvement / XP | Test Automation | Test-Driven Development (TDD) | Refactoring | Quality Engineering | Technical Mentorship

**Cloud & Technology Stack:** Azure (Kubernetes, Docker, Cosmos DB, Data Factory, Databricks, Key Vault) | GenAI / LLM Tools (GitHub Copilot, OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Junie, NotebookLM) | Infrastructure-as-Code (ARM Templates) | Advanced Diagnostics (KQL, App Insights) | Development Tools (Java, .NET / C\#, Node.js / JavaScript / TypeScript, Ruby, Oracle, SQL Server, Git, PowerShell, Regex, JSON)

**STRATEGIC IMPACT HIGHLIGHTS**

* **Organizational Transformation:** Pioneered the organizational shift at Maya from functional silos to outcome-oriented multidisciplinary teams, fostering delivery practices critical for enabling a predictable quarterly release cadence – same people, different culture.

* **Requirements Integrity:** Enabled implementation quality by raising critical questions about requirement conflicts during architecture board review, leading Regulator directors to champion a project pause for necessary strategic refinement.

* **Constraint Innovation:** Spearheaded a cross-functional effort with Apex Pipeline facility engineers to reclassify a hazardous laboratory location based on domain expertise, expanding hardware options and significantly reducing both project-specific and enterprise-wide costs.

* **System Observability:** Accelerated production issue resolution at the Regulator by using system observability in cloud-native microservices via advanced diagnostic tools, including complex KQL queries.

* **Friction Elimination:** Led Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) execution by automating Azure IaaS / PaaS provisioning with ARM templates, enabling consistency and eliminating environmental setup friction for external teams operating in Apex Pipeline-managed environments.

* **AI-Accelerated Engineering:** Leveraged AI code agents across 24 Regulator repositories to rapidly develop technical estimation which accelerated delivery planning for core domain changes.
